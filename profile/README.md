# Welcome to go-api-libs!

This organization is dedicated to creating and maintaining high-quality API libraries for Go. Our mission is to simplify API integration for developers by providing tools that are both efficient and accurate.

## API Libraries

Each repository under this organization, except for two special cases, represents a library for a specific API.

These libraries are generated from comprehensive OpenAPI specifications, which are enhanced with real API requests and responses for maximum accuracy.

Our libraries feature code generated directly from OpenAPI specifications, ensuring that the Go code reflects the true nature of each API, offering you a reliable and streamlined experience when integrating with external services.

## Standardized Error Handling

Check out our [api](https://github.com/go-api-libs/api) repository, which provides definitions for common API errors. This ensures consistent error handling across different APIs, making it easier for developers to manage error states.

## Common Types

The [types](https://github.com/go-api-libs/types) repository defines common data types like email addresses, with built-in marshalling, unmarshalling, and validation capabilities. This library helps maintain data integrity and ease of use across various API implementations.
